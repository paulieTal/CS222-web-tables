        Weekly Schedule Summary
    </h2>
    <p class="columns">
        This weekly schedule outlines my main activities and responsibilities throughout the week, including helping my
        mom at GCA, attending classes, completing school assignments, and participating in church activities. While the
        schedule helps me stay organized and maintain a balanced routine, it may still change depending on unforeseen
        events or last-minute plans. I always try to stay flexible and manage my time as best as I can to keep up with
        both school and personal commitments.
